					<h2>Atlantis Hub</h2>
					<p>
						As part of my Interaction Design Studio class, my team and I were tasked with creating a
						data-driven environmental display for the fictional Atlantis Transportation Hub. We designed an
						interactive experience for travelers and residents traveling between the San Juan islands.
						<br><br>

					<p>

						ROLES: &nbsp;UI/UX Design, Prototyping, Animation <br>
						TEAM:&nbsp; Matt Franklin, Jackie Hu, Kitty Bian <br>
						DURATION: &nbsp;1 month <br>
						TOOLS: &nbsp;Figma, Adobe Photoshop, Laser Cutting <br>
						FOCUS: &nbsp;Data Analysis, Personas, Controls, Motion, Wireframing <br>

					</p>
					<h4>BACKGROUND</h4>
					<p>
						The Atlantis Hub terminal display is a realtime data-driven environmental display located in the
						San Juan Islands transportation hub. The display provides information about planes, trains, and
						ferries, and a local unlimited ride pass option. We were given data consisting of over a hundred
						travel routes from the San Juan Islands, as well as three personas, consisting of the users and
						stakeholders. The goal of this project was to design a user-centered display to present the data
						in an engaging and interactive manner to address the needs of the main stakeholder and users.
					</p>
					<h4>CHALLENGE</h4>
					<p>
						Data displays in major transportation hubs often hold an abundance of information but can often
						be frustrating for travelers to read and understand as they look for information that is
						relevant to them while dealing with the stress of traveling.
					</p>
					<h4>OUTCOME</h4>
					<p>
						An interactive and accessible experience that allows users to engage with the data driven
						display and promotes the stakeholder's new PTF pass.
					</p>

					<h4>UNDERSTANDING OUR USERS AND STAKEHOLDERS</h4>
					<h5>Stakeholder - Elizabeth Duarte</h5>
					<ul id="content-list">
						<li>Promote the PTF Pass, a new product that offers great value and flexibility for travelers.
						</li>
						<li>* Offer a highly readable environmental data driven display. </li>
					</ul>
					<div><img src="../assets/images/ah-elizabeth.png"></div>

					<h5>Local Resident - George Shimko</h5>
					<ul id="content-list">
						<li>Wants to plan exciting itineraries for his grandchildren when they visit.</li>
						<li>* Plan travel routes and learn how to switch between different forms of transportation
							through the display. </li>
					</ul>
					<div><img src="../assets/images/ah-george.png"></div>

					<h5>Frequent Travler - Patrick Mulvaney</h5>
					<ul id="content-list">
						<li>Frequently travels between Seattle and San Juan Islands and wants to travel effectively.
						</li>
						<li>Easily identify alternative routes in case of delays or cancellations.</li>
					</ul>
					<div><img src="../assets/images/ah-patrick.png"></div>

					<h4>SKETCHES</h4>
					<p>We each used rapid ideation to hand sketch many different possibilities of
						presenting the data. Through parallel design, we were able to talk through each design and as a
						group choose what we liked from each design and bring those features together for the next
						iteration.</p>
					<div><img src="../assets/images/ah-sketches.png"></div>

					<h4>ITERATIONS</h4>
					<p>We then digitized our sketches using Figma. We created multiple iterations
						followed by a critique session for each iteration. We refined our design after each critique to
						create a delightful experience for users while meeting our stakeholder and users needs. In
						addition to the display screens, we incorporated an animation and control to facilitate an
						interactive experience.</p>
					<div><img src="../assets/images/ah-iterations.png"></div>


					<h4>FINAL DESIGN</h4>
					<h5>Information Architecture</h5>
					<p>The layout of the trip information is organized to make the most important data
						apparent at a glance. Our goal was to emphasize the trip that is leaving first and provide
						emphasis through a larger box, a lower opacity, larger font and more detailed information.</p>
					<div><img src="../assets/images/ah-info-arch.png"></div>

					<h5>Map Design</h5>
					<p>Several iterations of map design were required to find a balance between the
						familiar features of an accurate geographic representation, with the simplicity of a diagram.
						Once this balance was found the map was incorporated into the overall design and style to form a
						cohesive display.</p>
					<div><img src="../assets/images/ah-map.png"></div>

					<h5>Control Design</h5>
					<p>Our control consists of five buttons in the shape of the islands. When users
						press one of the island, the screen will display the sightseeing information of the island
						accordingly on the right side of the screen and zoom in on the selected island.</p>
					<div><img src="../assets/images/ah-control-design.png"></div>

					<h4>REFLECTION</h4>
					<p>This project presented a number of challenges in terms of both the design
						itself, and in learning to work effectively as a team on a unified design. We each began with
						very different perspectives on the best way to present the information for users and
						stakeholders. Through the use of personas, empathy mapping, and data models, we were able to
						come together to create a display that combined the best elements of each of our parallel
						designs into a combination greater than the sum of its parts. From that foundational design, we
						were able to build and iterate as a group to incorporate new elements of motion and interaction
						based upon our own reflection and feedback we received along the way. In the end, we were able
						to create a display that is both credible and enjoyable for our client and their customers.
