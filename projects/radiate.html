					<h2>Radiate</h2>
					<p>
						A group of 8 female college students from Women of Rewriting the Code launched a passion project
						aimed to help promote minority owned small businesses. I designed our website, Radiate, for
						consumers to explore minority owned small businesses across the country by emphasizing the
						stories behind businesses and how we can support them. <br><br>

						ROLE: &nbsp;Product Designer <br>
						TEAM: &nbsp; Dena Sabha <br>
						Duation: &nbsp; July 2020 - August 2020 (2 months) <br>
						METHODS: &nbsp; User Research, Web Design, Prototyping, Animation <br>
						TOOLS: &nbsp; Figma, Adobe Creative Suite <br>

					</p>
					<h4>BACKGROUND</h4>
					<p>
						The pandemic has been culturally devastating for communities. Hundreds of thousands of small
						businesses closed forever and to say the pandemic has left a crushing impact on small business
						minority owners is an understatement. We wanted to create a platform that allows people to
						search for and explore small businesses who are owned specifically by women, LGBTQIA+, people of
						color, or people with disabilities. Behind these businesses are real people with stories to
						tell, and currently there are no platforms that connect customers and businesses beyond the
						surface level. <br><br>
					</p>
					<h5>By May, one hundred thousand small businesses permanently closed due to the pandemic.</h5>
					
					<h4>CHALLENGE</h4>
					<p>
						Currently websites like Yelp, provide an abundance of information on stores based on reviews and
						ratings. These social networking sites drive consumers to explore based on reviews and ratings
						which do not emphasize business stories.
					</p>
					<h4>OUTCOME</h4>
					<p>
						A website that offers customers the chance to explore and support minority owned small
						businesses by exploring a consolidated list of small businesses and learning the stories behind
						each busines.
					</p>
					<h4>OUR SOLUTION</h4>
					<h5>Encouraging users to explore small businesses</h5>
					<p >Radiate's landing screen consists of three hero images to evoke emotions and
						demonstrate value propositions. The affordances and animations encourage users to keep scrolling
						to learn more about stories behind small businesses and how they can support them. </p>
					<div><img src="../assets/images/radiate-search.png"></div>
					<h5>Engage users to read stories and learn ways they can support</h5>
					<p >Delightful interactions on each page to engage the user in the story behind
						each small business. Convey detailed information about each business and encourage the user to
						learn how they can support each small businesses.</p>
					<div><img src="../assets/images/radiate-udupi.png"></div>
					<h5>Spotlight small businesses</h5>
					<p >Small businesses are grouped by categories and encourage exploration of the
						small businesses through a carousel. A different small business is spotlighted each week for
						users to have multiple points of interactions with stories. </p>
					
						<h4>USER RESEARCH</h4>
					<p>Through short interviews, we uncovered that people are eager to support
						minority owned small businesses but difficulties stemmed from not being able to find and learn
						about the small businesses. We surveyed over 60 people to uncover more painpoints and
						opportunities for our platform to address them.
						Social media was a very popular platform where people learned about struggling small businesses
						and ways they could support them. However, determining directions, hours, and other small
						businesses near-by would be a diligent process. There are many resources online that most people
						used such as Yelp, Google, etc. but more often than not, small businesses are overshadowed by
						large corporations.</p>
					<div><img src="../assets/images/radiate-user-research.jpg"></div>

					<h4>PAINPOINTS</h4>
					<ul id="content-list">
						<li>Small businesses are overshadowed by large corporations</li>
						<li>No consolidated list of minority owned small businesses</li>
						<li>No knowledge on story and mission statement behind a business</li>
						<li>Small businesses are not advertised heavily</li>
						<li>Little to no information on how to support</li>
						<li>Tend to turn to convenient options like Yelp</li>
					</ul>

					<div><img src="../assets/images/radiate-painpoints.jpg"></div>
					<h4>STYLE GUIDE</h4>
					<p >The goal of this platform is to create a spotlight on small businesses by
						coming together as a community. With our mission in mind, I designed a logo to reflect the power
						of everyone from different backgrounds coming together as a community.</p>
					<div><img src="../assets/images/radiate-logo-design.png"></div>
					<p>We wanted to create a warm and confident design and choose to use a light blue
						background paired with a navy blue foreground and muted red.​We choose to use different shade so
						blue to emphasize the sites's reliability and supportive nature. The red was chosen to reflect
						encouragement and passion.</p>
					<div><img src="../assets/images/radiate-painpoints.jpg"></div>
					
					<h4>LO-FIDELITY</h4>
					<p>We began our ideation by conducting a Figma brainstorming session with our
						engineers and each person designed a lo-fidelity mockup of what their vision for the website.
					</p>
					<div><img src="../assets/images/radiate-lo-fi.png"></div>
					
					<h4>MID-FIDELITY</h4>
					<p>The design team explored various color schemes and developed mid-fidelity
						mockups from our early designs. We presented these to users for usability testing and to better
						understand their needs.</p>
					<div><img src="../assets/images/radiate-mid-fi.png"></div>
					
					<h4>FINAL DESIGN</h4>
					<p>I designed high-fidelity prototypes based on the needs and painpoints
						discovered during usability testing sessions. I developed animations and interaction points to
						bring joy to the user experience.</p>
					<div><img src="../assets/images/radiate-high-fi.png"></div>
					
					<h4>REFLECTION</h4>
					<p>Moving forward, I would like to conduct more usability tests on this product
						and interview more small business owners and develop the designs further to address user and
						small business needs. Creating Radiate was a rewarding experience and I really enjoyed
						collaborating with students with diverse backgrounds to develop a concept we are all passionate
						about.
