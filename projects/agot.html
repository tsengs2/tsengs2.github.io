					<h2>Agot.AI</h2>
					<p>
						Agot.ai is an Artificial Intelligence startup that provides computer vision restaurant
						management tools. I joined Agot.ai as its first designer and designed a cashierless checkout
						system and order accuracy tracking system to address consumer and employee painpoints and
						established a consistent brand identity. <br><br>
					</p>

					<p>
						ROLE: &nbsp;Product Designer <br>
						Duation: &nbsp; Summer 2020 <br>
						METHODS: &nbsp; User Research, UI/UX Design, Rapid Ideation, Prototyping, Animation <br>
						TOOLS: &nbsp; Figma, Adobe Creative Suite, Framer <br>

					</p>
					<h4>BACKGROUND</h4>
					<p>
						Agot.ai is a computer vision restaurant manager company that offers real-time solutions to
						increase service accuracy for fast food restaurants. Agot.ai currently provides a system to
						automate the checkout process through AI technology, but does not have an application that
						allows employees to increase service accuracy. As the first product designer, I was responsible
						for designing multiple customer and stakeholder centered products.
					</p>
					<h4>CHALLENGE</h4>
					<p>
						In light of the pandemic, contactless food ordering and payments have been embraced by customers
						to provide a safe and efficient experience.
					<h5>The goal of my project is to explore ways to enhance the customer experience from checkout to
						order accuracy.</h5>
					</p>
					<h4>OUTCOME</h4>
					<p>
						Redesigned checkout system to allow customers to efficiently checkout via the restaurants tablet
						and designed a secure QR code checkout experience through personal mobile devices. <br><br>
						Designed an order accuracy system to streamline the order preparation process for employees and
						bring delight to customers beyond the store experience. <br><br>
						Startup signed an one million dollar contract with one of the largest restaurant chains in the
						country to implement the order accuracy system. <br><br>
					</p>
					<h4>OUR SOLUTION</h4>

					<h5>Order Accuracy</h5>
					<p>Agot's technology tracks each order from the point of sale to the preparation
						process. The kitchen display system provides a seamless experience for employees to be alerted
						of possible errors and how to correct the order. </p>
					<div><img src="../assets/images/agot-camera.png"></div>

					<h5>Cashierless Checkout</h5>
					<p>Display computer vision generated order summary and details. Guide a smooth and
						efficient payment process for customers.</p>
					<div><img src="../assets/images/agot-checkout.png"></div>

					<h5>QR Code Payment</h5>
					<p>Secure contact-less payment on mobile devices to streamline the order payment
						process and address current challenges. </p>
					<div><img src="../assets/images/agot-mobile.png"></div>

					<h4>PROBLEM SPACE</h4>
					<div><img src="../assets/images/agot-problem-space.png"></div>
					<p>An order accuracy system can improve the customer experience and aid in the
						reduction of food waste.
						Agot's technology effectively tracks an order throughout the preparation process but there is
						currently no employee facing experience to notify them of inaccurate orders. </p>

					<h5>How can we guarantee accurate orders?</h5>
					<p>The order accuracy system is a seamless experience for employees. The home
						screen is a live view of orders that are currently being prepared and keeps track of completed
						orders. When the system detects an incorrect orders, employees are notified to confirm the order
						they are preparing. </p>
					<div><img src="../assets/images/agot-employee.png"></div>

					<h5>Clear instructions to fix inaccurate orders</h5>
					<p>After employees confirm the order they are preparing, they are presented with
						changes they need to make. We are currently user testing the following screens to determine the
						most effective way to convey the errors to employees. Employees receive clear instructions at
						this stage on the changes they must make to orders. Once the appropriate changes are made, the
						system automatically classifies the order as completed. </p>
					<div><img src="../assets/images/agot-accuracy.png"></div>

					<h5>Seamless experience when no mistakes are detected</h5>
					<p>When prepared orders are correct, employees are notified as so and can proceed
						preparing other orders without interacting with the screen. Although this is an employee facing
						experience, it positively impacts the customer experience. </p>
					<div><img src="../assets/images/agot-seamless.png"></div>

					<h5>Customer Facing Problem</h5>
					<p>The cashier less checkout system Agot deployed at the time did not facilitate a
						smooth experience for both customers and employees. A contactless restaurant experience is
						necessary to ensure a safe experience for customers during the pandemic. The current checkout
						experience design did not optimize the order-to-fullfilmient process and lacked a consistent
						design language. The UI of the checkout lacked information architecture and contrast.</p>
					<div><img src="../assets/images/agot-customer-facing.png"></div>

					<h4>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h4>
					<p>I conducted competitive analysis on existing restaurant cashier less checkout
						systems and I created user flows that reflected the user experience for each system. I then
						mapped the user flow of made-to-order restaurants and identified painpoints in the flow that
						Agot's technology addressed.</p>
					<div><img src="../assets/images/agot-journey-map.png"></div>

					<h5>How can we facilitate an efficient and accurate checkout experience?</h5>
					<p>The redesigned checkout process alleviates the delayed checkout process in
						made-to-order restaurants. An accurate summary of each order is presented and customers are
						given the option to learn more details about their order. Customers can easily continue the
						checkout process on the POS system or can proceed with a contact-less method on their mobile
						devices.</p>
					<div><img src="../assets/images/agot-accuracy.png"></div>

					<h5>Two-Step Payment Process</h5>
					<p>Customers are guided through the two-step payment process and can easily
						inquire for help from an employee. To a facilitate a contact-less experience, this system is
						currently focused on credit card purchases and reducing the number of clicks users need to make
						to complete their checkout.</p>

					<h4>METRICS</h4>
					<ul id="content-list">
						<li>These solutions and designs lead to a million dollar contract with one of the largest fast
							food chains in the country.</li>
						<li>Designed end to end experiences that hundreds of thousands of people will use daily. </li>
						<li>As the first designer for the company,I established styling and branding guidelines for all
							applications. I wore multiple hats and was involved in multiple operations across the
							company. /li>
					</ul>

					<h4>REFLECTION</h4>
					<p>As the only designer on the team, it was great learning experience for me to
						take initiatives on technological solutions that were never considered in the past and be able
						to bring new perspectives into the development of the products. It was really rewarding to
						design end to end, multi-modal experiences in a fast-paced environment. This was my first time
						collaborating with PMs and engineers which was a very rewarding learning experience. Having
						brainstormed many solutions, some are still in the minimal viable product phase and moving
						forward I would like to conduct usability studies with restaurants employees to iterate upon the
						order accuracy system.</p>
